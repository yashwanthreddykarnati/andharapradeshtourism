    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Kakinada (listen‚ìò; formerly known as Cocanada) is a port city and municipal corporation in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.[8] Situated along the Bay of Bengal, it serves as the headquarters of Kakinada district and is a prominent economic and cultural centre in the region. The city is the sixth most populous city in the state and is recognised as one of India's most livable and cleanest cities among those with a population under one million.[9][10] Nicknamed the "Pensioners' Paradise," Kakinada is known for its well-planned layout and modern infrastructure.[11]

        The city rose to prominence in the mid-19th century, when the decline of the nearby Coringa port, caused by natural disasters and silting, redirected trade activities to Kakinada port. It became the administrative headquarters of the Godavari district in 1859, further growing as a cotton export hub during the American Civil War. By the late 19th century, Kakinada emerged as one of India's largest ports and the most significant in the Andhra region.[12] According to the 1891 census, Kakinada was the most populous city in the Andhra region, a status it largely retained until the 1930s.[13] During the colonial era, the city also gained importance as the starting point of the Buckingham Canal, a vital route for trade and transportation.[11]
        
        In modern times, Kakinada's economy is driven by industries such as fertilizer production, edible oil refining, natural gas extraction, food processing, IT, and power generation. The city also plays a vital role in the Krishna-Godavari Basin, serving as a key hub for petrochemical companies.[11] Culturally, Kakinada is known for its iconic sweet, Kakinada Kaja, and has been the hometown of several notable personalities in Telugu cinema. Historically, Telugu migrants to countries like Burma and Malaysia were referred to as "Coranghees," a term derived from the nearby Coringa port, which served as a major migration point in Andhra.[14][15]
        
        Kakinada is also an educational hub, hosting institutions such as Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University (JNTU), Rangaraya Medical College, the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) campus, and Andhra Polytechnic, the first polytechnic college in Andhra Pradesh. The city also boasts nearby attractions such as Hope Island, which acts as a natural barrier protecting it from cyclones and tsunamis, and the Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary, home to vast mangrove forests.[16] Notably, Kakinada was among the first 20 cities selected under the Smart Cities Mission.[17]</p>
