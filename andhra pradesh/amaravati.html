    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Amaravati (English: /…ôm…ôÀàr…ëÀêv…ôŒ∏…™/ …ô-muh-rah-vuh-thi, Telugu: AmarƒÅvati) is the capital city of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.[a] It is situated in Guntur district along the right bank of the Krishna River and southwest of Vijayawada. The city is named after the nearby historic site of Amaravathi, which was once the capital of the Satavahana dynasty around two millennia ago.[7] The city lies in Andhra Pradesh Capital Region.[8]

        The city is an urban notified area. Urban development and planning activities are undertaken by the Amaravati Development Corporation Limited[9] and Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA).[10] The APCRDA has jurisdiction over the city and the conurbation covering Andhra Pradesh Capital Region.[11] The city is spread over an area of 217.23 km2 (83.87 sq mi),[12] and comprises villages (including some hamlets) from three mandals viz., Mangalagiri, Thullur and Tadepalli.[13] The seed capital is spread over an area of 16.94 km2 (6.54 sq mi).[14]
        
        The bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014 resulted in the residual state having no capital city, with Hyderabad serving as the state's temporary capital city despite being located in the new state of Telangana. The government under the leadership of N. Chandrababu Naidu founded Amaravati and declared it as Andhra Pradesh state's new capital city. The farmers of Guntur district gave 33,000 acres of land, to the Government of Andhra Pradesh through an innovative land pooling scheme in return for developed plots and lease payments for 10-year period.[15][16] The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone at Uddandarayunipalem village on 22 October 2015.[17][18] After fast track completion of interim buildings, government legislature and secretariat started operating from the new facilities at Velagapudi from March 2017 </p>
